#ResetPrinterJobs

## Introduction
Sometimes when you print some files, the jobs get bugged and the printer stops printing. Also, after trying to remove those jobs/tasks, you realize that they do not get removed. A simple restart would fix the issue. Though, the batch files in this project will help you reset the jobs without having to restart ever again.

## How to Use
Get the the [ResetPrinterJobs.bat](ResetPrinterJobs.bat) file from the project. Then, execute it on your computer. Wait for it to finish. You are done.
